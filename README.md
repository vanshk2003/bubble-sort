# bubble-sort

Bubble sort in C is a straightforward sorting algorithm that checks and swaps elements if they are not in the intended order. 
It compares two adjacent elements to find which one is greater or lesser and switches them based on the given condition until the final place of the element is found.

Bubble sort is a data sorting algorithm that works by randomly copying elements from the first array into a smaller second array, and then reversing the order of these arrays. 
After this process has been repeated multiple times, the sorted data will be located in the middle of the larger array. 

The basic idea behind the bubble sort is to compare the elements of an array one by one until they are sorted in ascending order, which is called bubble bursting. 
When an element needs to be moved, instead of moving the entire array, only the element affected by the change is moved. 
This technique conserves memory and keeps overall execution speed high because there are fewer updates than with other sorting algorithms.
